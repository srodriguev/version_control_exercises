My body's on the line now
I can't fight this time now
I can feel the light shine on my face
Did I disappoint you?
Will they still let me over
If I cross the line?

[Verse 1]
Take a seat
But I'd rather you not be here for
What could be my final form
Stay your pretty eyes on course
Keep the memories of who I was before
So stay with me because

[Chorus]
My body's on the line now
I can't fight this time now
I can feel the light shine on my face
Did I disappoint you?
Will they still let me over
If I cross the line?
